      <p>
        HomePod is a powerhouse of a speaker. Apple‑engineered audio technology
        and advanced software deliver high‑fidelity sound throughout the room.
        It intelligently adapts to whatever it’s playing — or wherever it’s
        playing — and surrounds you in immersive audio that makes everything you
        listen to sound incredible.

        <h3>Room-filling oomph</h3>
        <p>
          A high‑excursion woofer packs HomePod with deep, rich bass. Its
          powerful motor drives the diaphragm a remarkable 20 mm, while its
          bass‑EQ mic dynamically tunes low frequencies in real time. Superclean
          bass. Fills the room. Boom.

        <h3>Hits the high notes</h3>
        <p>
          HomePod has an array of five beam forming tweeters around its base.
          They optimize high frequencies to produce detailed, articulate audio
          with stunning clarity. So you can enjoy crystal-clear vocals and all
          the details of the instruments — just as if you were there in person.

          into the middle of the room, and reflect ambient sound, like the
          backup band, off the walls — for fully immersive listening. And with
          Spatial Audio tracks, you’ll experience the sense of being surrounded

          Apple silicon unlocks advanced computational audio innovations in

          models in real time to preserve dynamic range and maximize acoustic

          With room sensing, HomePod automatically understands its location in a
          room by using its mics to listen for sound reflections. It tunes sound
          accordingly, so you’ll enjoy the best listening experience possible no
          matter where it’s placed.
