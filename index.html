        HomePod is a powerhouse of a speaker. Apple‑engineered audio technology
        and advanced software deliver high‑fidelity sound throughout the room.
        It intelligently adapts to whatever it’s playing — or wherever it’s
        playing — and surrounds you in immersive audio that makes everything you
        listen to sound incredible.

        <p>
          A high‑excursion woofer packs HomePod with deep, rich bass. Its
          powerful motor drives the diaphragm a remarkable 20 mm, while its
          bass‑EQ mic dynamically tunes low frequencies in real time. Superclean
          bass. Fills the room. Boom.

        <p>
          HomePod has an array of five beam forming tweeters around its base.
          They optimize high frequencies to produce detailed, articulate audio
          with stunning clarity. So you can enjoy crystal-clear vocals and all
          the details of the instruments — just as if you were there in person.
